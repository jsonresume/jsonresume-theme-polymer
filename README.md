# Boilerplate theme [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate.png)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate)

This is the boilerplate theme for [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/).

## Getting started

To get started with theme development, this is what you'll need:

- [node.js](http://http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs)
- [npm](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm)

If you're on Linux, you can simply run:

```
apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm
```

Or if you're on OSX and got [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed:
```
brew install node
```

### Installing the command line

We're going to use [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) to run our development server.  
Go ahead and install it:

```
npm install -g resume-cli
```
